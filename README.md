dataset = load_from_disk("./hf_datasets/v2")

# Or load directly from Hugging Face Hub
from datasets import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("selimfirat/bilkent-turkish-writings-dataset")

# Access train/validation/test splits
print(f"Train: {len(dataset['train'])} samples")
print(f"Validation: {len(dataset['validation'])} samples") 
print(f"Test: {len(dataset['test'])} samples")
```

#### Option 3: Zenodo Repository (Recommended for archival access)

import pandas as pd
from dataset_versioning import get_latest_version

# Get latest version info
latest = get_latest_version()
print(f"Latest version: {latest['version']} with {latest['num_entries']} entries")

# Load as pandas DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv(f"./versions/{latest['version']}/texts.csv")
print(df.head())
```

## üîÑ Dataset Maintenance

### Updating to a New Version

For dataset maintainers to create new versions with additional scraped content:

```bash
# Update dataset and create a new version
python update_dataset.py

# Push to Hugging Face Hub (requires HF_TOKEN environment variable)
python update_dataset.py --push

# Specify version number explicitly
python update_dataset.py --version 3
```

### Full Scraping from Scratch

To recreate the dataset completely from the source:

```bash
# Navigate to scraper directory and run
cd scraper
scrapy crawl bilkent_turkish_writings

# Convert PDFs to text
cd ../
python convert_to_text.py

# Alternative: Use the Jupyter notebook
jupyter notebook convert_to_text.ipynb
```

**Note**: Full scraping downloads ~2GB of PDFs. These can be safely deleted after text conversion.

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Usage

### Working with Dataset Versions

```python
# Initialize version control (creates v1 if needed)
from dataset_versioning import initialize_version_control
initialize_version_control()

# Get information about the latest version
from dataset_versioning import get_latest_version
latest = get_latest_version()
print(f"Latest version: {latest['version']} with {latest['num_entries']} entries")

# Convert specific version to Hugging Face format
from prepare_hf_dataset import convert_to_hf_dataset
dataset = convert_to_hf_dataset("v2")  # Specify any available version

# List all available versions
import os
versions = [d for d in os.listdir("./versions") if d.startswith("v")]
print(f"Available versions: {versions}")
```
